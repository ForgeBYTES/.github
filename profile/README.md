**ForgeBYTES** builds **LLM-driven byte-level** security tools.  

Our main project, **AnvilELF**, is an ELF binary analysis lab for inspection, mutation, and infection detection — powered by AI operator **Kurama**. Kurama is designed to analyze and mutate ELF binaries under user-defined tasks using built-in commands.

Built on a composition-first OOP philosophy, with **SOLID** principles, **full test coverage**, and a relentless focus on **maintainability**. Everything starts at the same level: **_bytes_**.

**Minimalism. Composition. Byte-level precision.**

- Inspection — Explore ELF structure down to the byte: headers, sections, segments, symbols, and relocations. Disassemble, validate, and visualize executables with surgical precision.
- Mutation — Modify headers, sections, and symbols in a controlled, reversible way.
Simulate exploits, obfuscation, or patching within a safe, testable environment.
- Detection — Identify anomalies, infections, or unauthorized binary changes.
Reveal hidden tampering through semantic and structural analysis.
- Kurama AI Operator — Interprets user intent and translates it into validated actions.
Guides inspection, mutation, and detection with reasoning, context, and byte-level control.
