# ForgeBYTES

**ForgeBYTES is a byte-level security lab focused on raw parsing, inspection, and manipulation â€” from ELF executables to network packets.**  

Built on a purist object-oriented philosophy, with SOLID principles, full test coverage, and a relentless focus on maintainability. Everything starts at the same level: _bytes_.

**Minimalism. Composition. Byte-level precision.**
