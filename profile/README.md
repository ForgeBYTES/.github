# ForgeBYTES ⚒️🔥

**ForgeBYTES is an LLM-driven security lab for binary inspection, mutation, and infection detection.**

Our main project, **AnvilELF**, is a next-generation ELF analysis framework that combines  
static inspection, structural validation, disassembly, and AI-assisted reasoning.  
It’s where human expertise meets LLM intelligence — turning binary structure into contextual insight.

Built on a purist object-oriented philosophy, with **SOLID** principles, **full test coverage**, and a relentless focus on **maintainability**.  
Everything starts at the same level: _bytes_.

**Minimalism. Composition. Byte-level precision.**
