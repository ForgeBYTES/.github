# ForgeBYTES ⚒️🔥

**ForgeBYTES** is an organization focused on building LLM-driven byte-level security tools.  

Our main project, **AnvilELF**, is an ELF binary analysis lab for inspection, mutation, and infection detection — powered by **Kurama**, an AI operator. Kurama is designed to analyze and mutate ELF binaries under user-defined tasks using built-in commands.

Built on a composition-first OOP philosophy, with **SOLID** principles, **full test coverage**, and a relentless focus on **maintainability**.
Everything starts at the same level: **_bytes_**.

**Minimalism. Composition. Byte-level precision.**
